# go-fordpass

Ford Pass is Ford's connected vehicle platform. On select vehicles, this enables first-party app control of locks, remote start, and vehicle telematics.

This project is a (partial) reimplementation of [ffpass](https://github.com/d4v3y0rk/ffpass), in Go.

# Features

On supported vehicles, the CLI supports

- Fetch Status (not yet pretty üí©)
- Lock/Unlock Doors
- Start/Stop Engine (Remote Start)

# CLI Usage

### `go get` or Clone Repo:

```
go get -u github.com/parrotmac/go-fordpass
# - or -
git clone https://github.com/parrotmac/go-fordpass.git

### Get Credentials

```

Alternatively, if not found in the environment, the CLI will prompt for the above values.
